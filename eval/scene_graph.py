    Uses CIE L*a*b* instead of HSV because:
      - Lightness (L*) is fully separated from chroma, so dark red/blue
        cars are not misclassified as achromatic.
      - The a* axis (green<->red) is linear — no hue wrap-around at red.
      - Perceptually uniform: equal distance ~ equal perceived difference.

    OpenCV stores LAB as uint8 with L in [0,255] and a,b in [0,255]
    centered at 128, so a and b are shifted back to the signed range here.

    gt_vocabulary=True switches to hue bins measured against the benchmark's
    colour vocabulary (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet, white,
    black) and is what the ROS2 perception output uses.  It differs from the
    default in three ways:

      - violet is split out of blue (measured: violet -48..-44 deg,
        blue -74..-54 deg -- adjacent but separable at -51),
      - the orange/yellow/green bounds are moved to where those hues
        actually land (measured yellow is 97..103 deg, which the default
        bins call green),
      - achromatic dark/light are named black/white.

    It is off by default so the offline eval path keeps the exact bins its
    numbers were produced with.

        Two frames, because prompts use both and they are not the same thing:

        * **n2 has a heading** — object-centric.  Project n1's offset onto n2's
          own direction of travel, so "behind the bus" means trailing the bus
          down the road.  This is what an object-anchored prompt means, and it
          is not recoverable from camera depth: a car ahead of the bus can be
          further from the camera than the bus is.
        * **n2 has no heading** (stationary, or too new for a history) —
          viewer-centric fallback.  On a ground plane a nearer object sits lower
          in the image, so vertical position orders depth.  Deliberately does
          not compare areas: n1 and n2 are usually different classes, and a car
          in front of a bus is still the smaller box.

        ``dx``/``dy`` are n1 - n2 in normalised image coords, already computed
        by the caller (right = +x, down = +y).

        Both branches work in units of image **width**.  ``cx_norm`` divides by
        width and ``cy_norm`` by height, so the normalised space is stretched by
        the aspect ratio — 1.78x on a 16:9 frame.  A dot product taken there
        over-weights the vertical term by the square of that (3.16x), which
        would make ``DEPTH_THRESH`` mean one thing for a road running up the
        frame and another for one running across it.  Rescaling y by the aspect
        undoes it, and dividing by the rescaled heading's length makes ``along``
        a signed distance rather than an unnormalised projection.
